I'm not sure how many people remember but I made a hugely upvoted post here 6 months ago about winning $100k in just one hour by doing some crazy options gambling. The sad thing was I lost all of that $100k plus lost a further almost $80k in like a week later by thinking I could replicate my success yet again. I deleted that 100k post of mine after that out of shame but I still have like 100+ people that had private msg'ed me from that post alone.

June was really the lowest point in my journey here as you can see in the image. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought I could have made every single penny back plus a whooping $35k more by the end of this year. And it's not even the end of the year! I actually could've earned another $30k extra last week if not for some dumb mistakes lol

I had to change my entire outlook on investing after that June fiasco and believe it or not, I never bought any options ever since then. I wasn't going the crazed gambling route again and for the past 2 months I actually made very little gains but it was a low risk route I took.

My $130k gain only came about in the past 2 weeks' bull market and by constantly changing up my stocks instead of bagholding. There's still been a lot of regrets here and there in how I wished I made some trading moves that could've earned me even more money,  but I guess I cant be too greedy.",1270,0.95,167,1732350986.0,"Craziest journey ever...

wallstreetbets,McDonald’s Espresso Machine Meltdown: $193M Burnt Nuggets or Billion-Dollar Golden Arches Play?,"This is weird. 

McDonald’s (MCD) is scrambling faster than a breakfast egg because their Melitta espresso machines just got yeeted out of every U.S. store. Safety concerns = no lattes, no cappuccinos, no mocha frappes. 🍮 A total 13,500 stores affected = $193M in financial black holes. But wait—it gets worse. If they don’t fix this fast, this could be McDonald’s ice cream machine scandal 2.0—with espresso.

The Drama
You know how they’re always like, “Sorry, the ice cream machine’s broken”? Well, now the espresso machines are dead too. McDonald’s had to RIP them out of every U.S. location because of some “unspecified safety concern.” I mean, who’s getting hurt by a cappuccino? Karen’s third-degree burn from asking for “extra hot”? 🔥☕

The Numbers
Here’s where it gets wild, fam. McDonald’s serves 27.2M customers a day in the U.S.:
	•	810K espresso drinks lost per day = $2.4M/day in lost sales.
	•	People skipping meals because no coffee = another $1.2M/day gone.
	•	That’s $153M in lost profit if this drags on for 60 days.
	•	Oh, and replacing the machines? Another $40.5M.

wallstreetbets,"A plain English explanation of MSTRs convertible bond strategy (sort of long, sorry)","I just sent this in an email to a friend of mine who was asking about MSTR.  I also participated in some discussions of this in a few threads here yesterday so figured I could post it here as well for all you regards.  It might read a little bit like this is an email I sent to a friend who is financially literate.. because that’s what it is. 

Note: I’m not taking a firm position on what Saylor is doing.  For the record I’m a longtime Bitcoin bull (and semi-maxi) but there’s no such thing as infinite money.  This has massive potential to end badly… but the music is playing a lots of us are dancing.

This post contains some commentary and some of my opinions.  I’m happy to answer questions or correct anything I have wrong but I don’t plan to get drawn into debates about my opinions or the value of bitcoin and whatnot.  That’s a different topic. 

Dear Regards,

So, his convertible bond strategy is actually a hint of genius with a side of trepidation.  Here’s the rundown:

He’s selling 5-year corporate bonds at 0% interest with a convert price that’s about 50% above the current share price (I think that’s the ratio… could change per issuance, not sure).  For this example let’s say the stock is trading at $500 and the convert price is at $750. 

MSTR then uses the bond proceeds to buy bitcoin and add it to their balance sheet.  Bitcoin goes up.  Their value per share goes up.  Numbers go up.   Forever, right?  Right guys??

(See note below on accounting treatment.)

If the bond holder keeps the bonds for the full 5 years they get their principle paid back without interest.  

However if at any point in that 5 years the stock is trading above the convert price, the bond holder can surrender the bond and be issued stock shares (freshly created for the conversion) equivalent to the bond value at the convert price.  So if the shares are trading at $800 they could convert a $1m bond into 1,333 shares ($1m / $750 = 1333) and cancel the bond.  They would then have an implied profit of $66k on their million dollars ($50 above convert x 1333 shares).  They could sell to lock in profits or if they keep the shares they get additional upside/downside (or some combination)

That conversion is dilutive to existing shareholders but it only happens if the stock has already appreciated so the shareholders have been totally fine with it.  

The bond holders have an incentive to convert as it allows them to take profits ahead of the the 5 year term and they can either hold the shares or sell them or some combination.   Of course there is also a secondary market for these bonds and they are trading well above par in anticipation of high convert value. 

Once converted, the bond is paid/void.  So if his stock keeps going up he never has to pay back the bonds (with cash, anyway).

IIRC, the first bond issued like this was at a par value of $100 per share with a $140 convert price.   That was pre-split… so 1/10 that for current value ($10 per share with a $14 convert in today’s shares).  So those folks have done pretty well.  

So, these bonds are giving fixed income investors the upside exposure to Bitcoin and they are absolutely gobbling it up.  Most of those portfolios can’t buy bitcoin and many can’t even buy stocks/ETFs… but Bitcoin, wrapped in stock, wrapped in bonds… shut up and take my money!!!  

What could go wrong 😂

I’ve heard rumors that the next MSTR bond offering is going to be at a negative interest rate (ie investors will have to pay more than face value to buy the bond). 

However if the stock price doesn’t rise and the converts don’t happen, he’s on the hook to pay the bond back at the maturity date.  He has three options: (1) roll the debt into new bonds if the market will tolerate it, (2) pay the bonds off with cash on hand or with cash from the operating side of the business, or (3) sell enough of the underlying bitcoin to raise the cash.  He has said he will “never sell” but when push comes to shove who knows.  

Edit to add: he could also (4) issue additional shares to raise capital to pay off the bonds.  This would dilute shareholders and hurt his stock price but would be a valid strategy if needed. 

Of course if he’s having to sell some of his coins we can assume we are already in a deep bear market.  This selling would of course push the price down further.  Rinse and repeat.  That would suck.  And the more and more of these bonds he sells, the less and less likely it is that the operating business will have enough cash to pay them off.  Could get spicy. 

Importantly none of the Bitcoin are encumbered in these bonds and there is no opportunity for them to be called early or “margin called” in any way even if bitcoin price drops to zero.  They just need to pay off the bonds when they come due (if they ever come due). 

He is aware of the typical 4-year bitcoin boom and bust cycle and I expect he is structuring his maturity dates to account for when he would expect market lows and highs.  But that’s far from a guarantee.  

If he can’t pay the bonds he’s looking at an epic bankruptcy and his coins getting liquidated to pay creditors.  This would also cause massive market selling by essentially everyone frontrunning their bankruptcy sale.  FTX nods with knowing approval.  (Note this isn’t FTX 2.0 here… Saylor is doing this all in the open… this isn’t fraud it’s clever with risk)

His underlying plan is to entice other companies to follow in his footsteps so he’s not the only one pumping bitcoin.  I’m seeing more and more announcements all the time.  People are taking notice of his success.  I think this is really where the systemic risk applies.  MSTR is early to this game.  So far they are playing the game conservatively (well, ok… “conservatively”).    

But as other companies follow him down this path they will get more and more aggressive. It’s human nature.  Take what’s working and leverage it to the tits.  Once we have the lower third of the S&P index all doing the Saylor to goose their profits and bitcoin is trading in the millions and somebody fucks up because they took the bitcoin wrapped in stock wrapped in bonds and wrapped that in dog shit and wrapped that in cat shit and then sold it to the Saudis… the implosion risk is off the charts and it will be a huge risk/impact to the overall markets.  It will also wipe out anyone buying Bitcoin leverage long.  Dont fuck with BTC leverage kids. 

Interestingly tho… even it this all blows up it doesn’t threaten the bitcoin network.  The price will crash, sure, but miners will mine (some will go out of business but others will survive).  The network will still process transactions, there will still only ever be 21million coins.  And the price will recover to some level that reflects future demand.  No idea if it would ever recover to a new all time high… but it would survive and continue to function.   If you have your coins in self-custody you’ll be safe (aside from crying over the massive loss in dollar value).  Some new narrative would take over.  The asset would remain scarce.  A new narrative would emerge.  

Of course then there is all this talk of creating a national Bitcoin reserve where nation states are all in an arms race to aquire BTC.  For the record I’m very unenthusiastic about the National Bitcoin Reserve thing even if it would pump my bags.  It might happen but I don’t love the idea of massive government involvement in bitcoin.  

That said, Bitcoin is a permissionless network so if governments want to buy it there’s nothing anybody can do to stop them.  It’s a feature not a bug.  

Also regarding accounting treatment.  Bitcoin is current held with the tax treatment of “indefinite intangibles”.  This is the most conservative tax treatment possible.  It is for valuing things like art and trading cards.  If the value goes up you cannot recognize the appreciation higher than your purchase price.  If the value goes down you must recognize the loss (as an operating loss!). 

So that really sucks from a corporate perspective and I expect it has kept a lot of companies on the sidelines.  

The FASB accounting rules are changing in 2025 to shift bitcoin to fair value accounting. Going forward companies will mark to market quarterly (or whenever they announce earnings) and it will apply the profit or loss to the corporate treasury balance rather than operating income.   This will be a much more fair treatment and is the right way to do it given that Bitcoin has a very clear price discovery mechanism.  

Importantly, when MSTR reports their first earnings under this new rule, they’re going to be able to recognize all of the performance of all of the Bitcoin they have purchased.  Tons of it has been marked down (impared) since the drop from $69k to $15k.  And they haven’t been able to recognize gains on anything above price paid (ever!) on their official earnings statements.  Their first earnings of 2025 are going to be insanely higher than past and if the street is maintaining this high multiple it will get a lot of attention.  

On the other hand none of this is a secret so it’s probably already priced in.  It could explain some of the crazy price action lately as we get closer to Jan 1.  I think their fiscal year ends Dec31 so Q1 earnings in April would see the 🚀 in their standard balance sheet.  

A brave new world.

tl;dr long Bitcoin, long MSTR, massive risk once tons of other companies follow suit because people are greedy bastsrds and will lever this strategy to the tits and it will blow up in a supernova of financial ruin… and Bitcoin will still keep chugging along same as it ever was.

tl;dr2 in five years Saylor will either be the richest man in the world or he’ll be in the back of the Turkish embassy being dismembered by a Saudi hit squad for destroying MBS’s oil fortunes.

Death, taxes, and caffeine being centerfold in American society. The explosion of $CELH into the energy drink market took the sector by storm, and investors gobbled up the stock. In four years, the company became the third most popular energy drink in the United States behind just Rebull and Monster, That kind of growth is unprecedented in a stagnant industry like soft drinks.

But then sentiment changed and the exponential growth began to slow as the industry faced inflationary headwinds and gas station traffic decreased. Retail investors dropped CELH faster than the democrats dropped Biden.

I'm here to tell you the market is wrong about Celsius, and in two years you will be wishing you had read this post and got onboard.

The underlying fundamentals of the business are incredibly strong and there remains massive global growth potential. Every quarter, CELH is a profitable business. They posted $0.28 EPS in Q2. They have close to a BILLION dollars of CASH on hand. This past quarter, their largest distributor, Pepsi, did an inventory optimization that decreased sales for the quarter by $150 million and the company STILL broke even for the quarter. CELH announced the inventory optimization is complete and those sales will resume for Q4.

Any business needs to be incredibly healthy to take a one-time $150 million decrease in sales for a quarter on the chin and STILL be operating in the green. Retail investors looked at the decreased quarterly revenue and panic sold the stock without listening to the earnings call and actually understanding the numbers. It was a one-time, inventory optimization with the expectation of sales resuming in Q4. And that's what we've seen with the stock price - while retail investors have abandoned the stock, institutional ownership has increased 400% in 2024.

CELH sales growth in the United States has continued to outpace competition and global marketing/sales remain in the early stages. The top line has enormous grwoth potential in global markets. Meanwhile, in Q3 CELH bought Big Beverages in an all cash transaction in order to vertically integrate one of their major manufacturers. The facility is massive and the acquisition is expected to decrease per-case production cost and further improve margins.

wallstreetbets,Here is how the MSTR Can Reach 2000 By The End Of The Year 2024... I was bearish 2 weeks ago. What do you guys think?,"https://preview.redd.it/62lk42brvi2e1.png?width=1011&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d5883631884d2e4b5b6133447fd8e23a7cb34e2

I finally understand and realize how MSTR’s stock could grow so quickly if everything goes as planned. Here’s my view of a relatively bullish scenario that could unfold by the end of 2024:

In just the last two weeks, Saylor bought 29K and 52K BTC using stock offerings (ATMs). As the stock price and trading volume are now much higher (2x from last week plus stock price is 50% higher), he’ll likely buy even more BTC weekly.

Let’s assume the premium remains steady, allowing Saylor to keep leveraging it to buy as much BTC as possible. If he continues issuing shares through ATM programs and announces new purchases weekly, and adds debt every two weeks as he’s been doing, the pace could accelerate further.

He might even raise more than the planned $42B since the demand is there. It's insane, how fast they are growing. He said he will get $1.7B debt, then two days later he raised to $2.6B, and after several hours announced $3B. All this happened this week.  
If no one intervenes, he could potentially aim for holding 20% of all BTC—around 4 million coins. But this scenario stops at 1.38M BTC by the EOY 2024.

These numbers feel realistic yet conservative. If things heat up further, this could look even more dramatic. Although the stock trading volume is growing, here the assumption is that it will decrease.

Just two weeks ago, these projections would have seemed completely ridiculous to me. But now, it’s all starting to make sense.

I made a comparison of the top btc-linked equities who own the most btc... a) MSTR, b) MARA, and c) HUT ... i want to preface this by saying *all* BTC-linked equities deserve *some* premia in a bull market. The question is how much & when.

MSTR was trading at $478K per bitcoin yesterday morning... so yesterday's correction was *good* news... it re-rated... to <$400K per bitcoin... i have a feeling the premia is gona expand again though and Saylor will tap the convert markets 3-4x more from now until the Spring. The stock can double from here. Because MSTR's software operations are winding down, it justifies its premia by promising it will be a sort of 'bitcoin bank' in the future. TBD.

MARA was never really known on Wall Street for its HODL, but since the shares were flat as BTC went from $60K to $90K, the HODL now puts it in the top 3 BTC treasury plays. In the past, 80-90% of MARA's market cap was attributable to its operating company: the mining facilities. That has now changed. It's become more & more of a BTC proxy. This is a monumental shift. I didn't believe it 100% until I crunched the numbers, and looked at their latest debt offering... MARA is a top 2 mining/HODL play. It's a new landscape for miners.

HUT was always known as the classic HODL play if you didn't want to touch MSTR... especially as BTC ETFs didn't have any options contracts. If you wanted levered long BTC exposure, you had to either play MSTR or HUT. When MSTR got out of control, traders looked to call options on HUT to get that levered long exposure. HUT is still the biggest HODL play in the mining arena, and due to the recent underperformance, it's also the best value (in terms of cheapest price per BTC). HUT shareholders have also been much less diluted than MARA shareholders, and HUT's float is much tighter than MARA's. Furthermore, HUT's short intrst is double MARA's, creating extra volatility. I suspect the options market on HUT will begin to price this in as HUT shares begin to move again, but nobody knows. They can always sink too. HUT's smaller size has the added benefit of making it a more realistic M&A target (for both corporates and PE), which is always a nice uplift due to the premia often paid to shareholders in a buyout scenario. I like both HUT and MARA at these levels.

wallstreetbets,Simulating buying Microstrategy (MSTR) shares vs buying Bitcoin,"My understanding is that the market cap is approximately 3 times the value of its Bitcoin holdings, so for say $100 invested you effectively get $33 worth of the underlying asset, Bitcoin. On the face of it that seems like a bad deal.

Is their strategy to dilute the shareholding and use the proceeds to buy more Bitcoin?

For example, if $10 is raised my shareholding is now 0.91 of what it was originally (now 100/110). There is now $43 worth of Bitcoin, of which I have $39 ($43 x 0.91). Okay, this seems like an improvement from the original starting place – but I would still have done better if I just purchased the underlying asset directly.

Proponents will be quick to point out that by MSTR buying Bitcoin it may push up the price of Bitcoin itself. Let’s assume the price goes up by 20%. Under the above example I end up with $47 worth of Bitcoin for the $100 I invested. If I had simply bought $100 of Bitcoin in the first instance I would now have $120, so it still seems a very bad deal.

Now repeat this ad infinitum, also using different Bitcoin increase percentages and different dilution amounts. Go on, it can be done on a basic spreadsheet! There’s no combination which results in the amount of underlying asset “catching up” with what the value would be by simply buying Bitcoin itself! Therefore, why would anyone who is bullish on Bitcoin buy these shares? Likewise, why would anyone who is bearish on Bitcoin buy the shares when it is basically Bitcoin plus air? Is there a mistake in the above calculations or does this whole thing make no sense?",45,0.83,112,1732288330.0,Simulating buying Microstrategy (MSTR) shares vs buying Bitcoin,"My understanding is that the market cap is approximately 3 times the value of its Bitcoin holdings, so for say $100 invested you effectively get $33 worth of the underlying asset, Bitcoin.

wallstreetbets,$U - A potential game engine comeback story.,"Wanted to try it out so here's my first 'analysis'! Let me know if my points are valid and if my structuring is good or not.

Firstly for some background information, $U or Unity Software Inc is primarily game engine company where although producing a relatively good game engine, has made some incredibly poor choices - such as mass layoffs and diverging from their engine to focus more on advertising, merging with Iron Source. The company peaked in value November '21 at almost $200 (USD) where the company began merging with other companies, months after the decently successful IPO - the first merger being with Weta Digital. After that peak, it was all downhill from there tumbling into the $40s over the course of two years, where Unity made gaming history by announcing the runtime fee. This lead to the regarded CEO resigning (the CEO that once ran EA, go figure) and most of management being fired, with major restructuring a few months after occurring under interim CEO Jim Whitehurst and then Matthew Bromberg, where they promised to work on what truly mattered, the engine itself.

In recent times, Unity has made great strides in their engine with massive new features on the way - promising better performance (they don't say it, but they subtly hint it in their advertising that Unity is the engine for good performance, as opposed to Unreal), and new innovative uses of that big A word that investors climax over. They announced Unity 6, their big update and reversion back to a normal naming system as opposed to their weird yearly naming scheme (which was objectively bad for pressuring new releases on a yearly schedule), and announced 6.1 with some features currently in alpha releases, and some credible promises for later big versions which they appear committed on.

Overall, they seem to be on a comeback, at least on the engine side. Financially, they've been recovering from the whole runtime debacle (around Q4-23) where the next quarter being their first missed earnings for a while, by quite a bit as well. Where only recently in Q2-24 have they started to beat the target and are on track to go above $0 per share in the next two years. In addition, as a result of the cancellation of the runtime fee and the new CEO reaching out to businesses and the community, growth has been re-sparked. Moreover, their profits from their engine have increased 5% year over year and is still going strong. In the recent Q3 earnings their total profits in EBITDA is over 10% over their initial estimate of $70-80m at $92m.

My verdict, is that the company under its new leadership has shifted its focus towards the user. They are focussing on updating their engine without hurting users using older features, and are in the testing phases of new AI technologies for both advertising (reducing ROI and boosting user acquisition + monetary gain), and game development (with two AI systems for both helping developers make games, and running AI within games for either NPCs or game systems). Thus, after a 'company reset' they seem to be on the track to make a profit and become the defacto game engine - one that won't be made fun of crappy games.

Disclaimer - this is not financial advice. I'm a game developer and I enjoy using their engine (which is how I can say the engine is getting far better in recent releases for engine users), I recently got into trading/investing and I read these analysis posts or bets, and I decided to try one out myself.

How'd I do?

wallstreetbets,$PACS a potential x3 bagger,"First DD, not sure I am doing it right  
  
**TL;DR: Risky bet on recovery of $PACS after potential dismissal of covid-era fraud**  
**I've been long PACS for a while**   
**Positions: (see screenshot)**  
  
Excellent DD by another regard: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fgnku5/pacs\_prestige\_acquisition\_finalized\_so\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fgnku5/pacs_prestige_acquisition_finalized_so_earnings/)  


$PACS - skilled nursing facilities (SNF) assisted living facilities in the USA (in short Nursing home)  
Provides senior care and independent facilities, buy/lease real-estate for health care related properties

Founded in Utah in 2013, IPO in 2024  
Similar company: $ENSG  
Revenue: Coming from leasing facilities and insurance reimbursement based on the number of residents  
Finalized acquisition by taking over operations of Prestige Care’s entire SNF portfolio i.e 56 facilities across 6 states and added 2889 skilled nursing beds

Occupancy rate of 94% for all facilities they have managed for 18 months  
  
Why PACS? 

Hindenburg research made a claim that PACS is inflating their numbers by abusing covid era waiver to make more money as well as misleading investors with wrong CMS ratings.  
The claim is that the same revenue cannot be achieved and possibly fraud

What's the waiver about? It allowed beneficiaries to receive Medicare-covered SNF care without a prior hospital stay of at least three days. It expired with the end of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) on **May 11, 2023**

=> PACS have seen a sharp decline after those allegations leading to more than 60% decline, below it's IPO price!

Furthermore, they delayed their earnings because of that only releasing preliminary earnings: [https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/113/pacs-group-provides-preliminary-third-quarter-operational-metrics](https://ir.pacs.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/113/pacs-group-provides-preliminary-third-quarter-operational-metrics)

So:

\* Based on it they are still beating expectations and they stated that they are aware of those allegations and working with government entities and another 3rd party audit to make sure that they were always compliant.   
\* Fraud allegations are not related to cooked books but rather using Covid-era to pump up revenue  
\* Covid era waiver is long gone but revenue is still up  
  
This could go both ways: if the claim made by Hindenburg research was actually wrong PACS could easily go back to $40 (i.e almost doubling current price)  
If it was indeed true, expect PACS a loss of revenue in the next earning release or two but **the nursing facilities and occupancies aren't going away**.

wallstreetbets,NVDA may see red next week,"This isn’t bear porn and I’m going to get flamed for this one, but I think NVDA has a red week coming.  Earnings were very good, beating on both EPS and rev, but guidance came in conservative.  Gross margins were also down slightly to 74.6% from 75.1% in the previous quarter(still insane numbers).  The issue with this slight deceleration is that the stock is priced for exponential growth like we’ve been seeing for a couple years now.  That ridiculous growth may be slowing down a little for now, and their new Blackwell chips are still rolling out.  We don’t know what kind of revenue those will bring in yet.  The stock got plenty of price hikes post earnings, but nothing too significant(160-170’s for the most part).  It just seems like the train is slowing down a bit.  

As far as the chart goes, it has tried to break and hold $149-150 7 times since November 6.  It briefly broke over the day after earnings, but was quickly bitch slapped back below that threshold.  IMO, this earnings report was the catalyst that it needed to get over that resistance, and it has clearly failed to do so. So the question is: where do we go from here?  We’re right on the trend line that it’s held since September 6.  We could go higher, but earnings failed to impress the market, and it doesn’t seem like we have enough gas to pump it higher just yet.  We saw some significant selling pressure today without any buyers stepping in EOD.  I think that trend continues Monday and we break the trend line.  That is a solid red daily candle today, and I expect to see a gap down and another candle just like that on Monday. I would love to see it hit the 100 day EMA(right around $130) and bounce from there.  Thats definitely the spot to load up on calls if you’re still bullish(which you should be).  

One more risk over the next few days and weeks:  geopolitical tensions.

Earnings were very good, beating on both EPS and rev, but guidance came in conservative.  Gross margins were also down slightly to 74.6% from 75.1% in the previous quarter(still insane numbers).  The issue with this slight deceleration is that the stock is priced for exponential growth like we’ve been seeing for a couple years now.  That ridiculous growth may be slowing down a little for now, and their new Blackwell chips are still rolling out.  We don’t know what kind of revenue those will bring in yet.  The stock got plenty of price hikes post earnings, but nothing too significant(160-170’s for the most part).  It just seems like the train is slowing down a bit.    As far as the chart goes, it has tried to break and hold $149-150 7 times since November 6.  It briefly broke over the day after earnings, but was quickly bitch slapped back below that threshold.  IMO, this earnings report was the catalyst that it needed to get over that resistance, and it has clearly failed to do so. So the question is: where do we go from here?  We’re right on the trend line that it’s held since September 6.  We could go higher, but earnings failed to impress the market, and it doesn’t seem like we have enough gas to pump it higher just yet.

wallstreetbets,"Big win with $hims, FDA didn’t side with pharma like everyone thought they would💊📈
","**Background:**

* **GLP-1 Demand :** Wegovy (Novo) and Zepbound are dominating the branded weight-loss markets but face demand that they cannot keep up with.
* **Trump’s Legacy:** Under the Trump administration, rules around drug compounding were clarified, allowing pharmacies to fill gaps during shortages. Now, these policies will be central to ongoing lawsuits ([see this executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-ensuring-essential-medicines-medical-countermeasures-critical-inputs-made-united-states/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ncl_amplify&utm_campaign=230724-agenda47_returning_production_of_essential_medicines_back_to_america_and_ending_bidens_pharmaceutical_shortages&utm_content=ncl-7CGRrbfsEr&_nlid=7CGRrbfsEr&_nhids=NJKu9Lb)).
* **FDA issues:** The FDA pulled tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) from the shortage list in October but has since walked back on this after legal challenges, extending the compounding window significantly.

**Why It Matters:**

* **HIMS’ Edge:** FDA uncertainty + Trump-era compounding policies = opportunity for HIMS to take over affordable GLP-1 market.
* **GLP-1 Customer base:** There are even more GLP-1 customers than expected which leaves a huge opportunity to take advantage of.  There is [over 6% of the U.S.](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/#:~:text=Overall%2C%2012%25%20of%20adults%20say,Obesity%20Drugs%20for%20Racial%20Disparities) taking a variant of it currently.
* **Hims Undervalued:** Hims is currently significantly undervalued due to the risk of lawsuits and competitors. My research into their competitors showed that they are not great considering some like RO health require a $145 month subscription to be prescribed GLP-1 which is another $300 a month subscription on top of that vs HIMS being a flat rate $200 a month which includes free chatting with a doctor anytime.
* **Hims In-house Compounding Advantage:** Hims acquired their own [compounding pharmacy](https://news.hims.com/newsroom/building-our-pharmacy-operations-with-the-customer-in-mind) to produce their drugs. This allows them to control the quality and ensure their customers get what they order which is important with compounded drugs. They recently got a [global head of quality & safety](https://investors.hims.com/news/news-details/2024/Hims--Hers-Appoints-Tenured-Pharmaceutical-Regulatory-and-Quality-Experts-to-Key-Leadership-Positions/default.aspx) who has over 30 years in pharma and FDA so the FDA cannot say it is unsafe to compound.
* **Big Pharma Hit:** Lilly and Novo stocks have been tumbling for the past few months due to the wavering support for Medicare/Medicaid covering their drugs for anti-obesity which is now very unlikely to pass with RFK being staunchly against it. It is still possible to get it if you have an added health benefit like Obesity + diabetes etc.

**Takeaway:**

* FDA delays + Trump rules = lifeline for $HIMS. The compounded drug wave could crash if regulators tighten up but the price is already undervalued. This becomes more unlikely further into the Trump presidency as cutting off a European company that has the GDP of Denmark aligns with their goals.

Oh, and Hims added meal replacements today. Branching out and adding more streams of revenue that align with their goals is a +1 in my book.

**TL;DR**: Hims & Hers ($HIMS) was up 11% as the FDA delayed its decision on Eli Lilly’s ($LLY[) Zepbound and Mounjaro shortage status](https://www.barrons.com/articles/eli-lilly-zepbound-wegovy-hims-hers-stock-8e6d9861). This pause keeps compounders going and sets precedence for HIMS when Semaglutide is removed from shortage list. There is also Trumps past executive order which will most likely be pushed through to this situation if the court cases are dragged out. European companies like Novo would be significantly impacted by this and the trump administration will take this as a win.

PS: Currently hold around $20k in MSTR stocks

A summary part from a section of article

Critics argue that MicroStrategy’s valuation reflects speculative excess. The company’s fully diluted market cap—its theoretical value if all convertible notes and stock options are converted into shares—is approximately $106 billion, far exceeding its Bitcoin holdings' market value of $31.2 billion. Adjusting for $4.2 billion in debt, this premium appears even more pronounced.

Moreover, the feedback loop driving MicroStrategy’s stock performance depends on continued Bitcoin appreciation and ETF inflows. If either of these factors reverses, MicroStrategy’s valuation could rapidly ""revert to the mean.""

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I've been through this rodeo before where the market blasts off in a short window to just wreck my account.  Basically 2020-2021 and then all of 2022.

If I sell I'm looking at a larger tax bill but it only means I made money afterall.

I'm looking for advise, do you think its wise to start to take some off the table or have you started to sell?

* **Earnings beat** revenue expectations with $6.82B (+18% YoY) and EPS of .92 (+31% YoY and spot on with projection) 
* Data center revenue surged **+122%**, proving AMD is gaining AI momentum.
* Recent selloff (-$30/share) was a **market overreaction** to slightly soft Q4 guidance.

1. **Reduction in Force**: Cutting 4% of workforce to focus on AI chip development.
2. **New Leadership**: CFO transition positions AMD for its next growth phase.
3. **IBM Partnership**: MI300X accelerators are now a key piece of IBM Cloud’s AI stack.

stocks,Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.

stocks,What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",466,0.85,150,1732271709.0,What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.

stocks,Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

stocks,Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.  **2.0 The real problem**  The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.  The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.  The number of buyers has been flat.  Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***  Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***  ***So, where are the buyers?***  As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:  ""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""  The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.  I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:  1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy. 2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper. 3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy. 4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).  **3.0 What is Etsy doing?**  Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.  Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.  **4.0 The take-rate**  The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.  The company splits its revenue into two groups:  * **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees). * **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.  Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.  **5.0 Terrible management decisions**  As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:  * **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**. * **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**. * **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.  It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!  Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.  A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.  **6.0 Historical financial performance**  Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.  Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).  **7.0 Valuation**  The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:  * **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation. * **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.  Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.  Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:  1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time. 2. The number of buyers will start growing again 3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products. 4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

stocks,"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

stocks,Zeta global short attack,"Hi, I've been following ZETA global for quite while now. It has recently suffered a 50% blow to its SP due to not good enough earnings followed by a report from short seller ""Culper research"".
 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

stocks,Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

stocks,Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow.

stocks,Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

10% Hood

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

stocks,What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?,"What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?

It is often recommended that investors just stick to ETFs such as SPY because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks. If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time and closer to like 10% or higher in the last couple years. 
Anyway I see S&Ps high income ETF is just under 12% TTM. So does that mean if I have $100,000 I would get $11,950 in dividends a year? Wouldn’t this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn’t everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

stocks,How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",0,0.41,29,1732236473.0,How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:  Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:  Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg.

stocks,The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

stocks,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

I am optimistic that SMR nuclear reactors are going to become mainstream in the coming years. And I believe quantum computing is finally here, and real world applications are popping up every day.   My personal picks for these three categories are RDW, OKLO and IONQ. Let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options. I have a small stake in all three.   Apreciate the responses!  ",0.375,0.13177083333333334
stocks,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

stocks,Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.     DISCLAIMER: I'm already a shareholder",0.0,0.06734473009983216

stocks,Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",12,0.81,7,1732057887.0,Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.

stocks,Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

stocks,Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

$8k is the only around 10% of my liquid investment (not counting 401k, etc).

TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",279,0.88,67,1731903761.0,Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[     TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

stocks,MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

**TLDR:** Short term short. I don't have an opinion on long term for this stock.

I will be entering the options route :  270 Put 17th Jan 2025.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

stocks,BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance.

However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.    * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.       * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.       * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.  Now, there are many long term potencials:  * A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.    * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage. * Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.    * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024. * Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.    * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).    * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.    * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.  To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance.

stocks,My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

stocks,Chris Wright - CEO of Liberty Energy and board member of Oklo Inc. tapped to be US Energy Secretary,"[Link to the article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-names-fossil-fuel-executive-213214952.html)

>  
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.

>CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of [oil and gas development](https://apnews.com/hub/oil-and-gas-industry), including fracking, a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

>Wright has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end [a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals](https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc) by the Biden administration.

>Wright also has criticized what he calls a “top-down” approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.

>Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.

>Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to [donate $1 billion to Trump’s campaign](https://apnews.com/article/schumer-democrats-big-oil-price-fixing-collusion-07a8583a2b12e645d2860608c626cc7c), with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.

>Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright’s experience in the energy sector “gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership"" of the Energy Department.

>“We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE’s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world,"" Sommers said.

>Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright “a champion of dirty fossil fuels"" and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was “a disastrous mistake.”

>“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,"" Wong said. “Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE’s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.""

stocks,PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",31,0.83,4,1731720151.0,PENN - Anybody seeing this?

Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app.   Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?  Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?  Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",0.25,0.16285666639440227
stocks,Pfizer- am I stuck with take lock or is this a great value? ,"Disclosure is I am down 15% on this and it’s about 3% of my portfolio. 

I normally hate pharma stocks, but I nibbled at this one because it’s Pfizer. They impressed me with the Covid vaccine and are a well known name. This also seems very undervalued on the fundamentals and they have a potential blockbuster obesity drug (once a day pill) on the horizon. 

It’s down 4.5% today due to RFK being named HHS director, which seems like a nothing burger to me. 

6.5% dividend and from what i read, they have a decent drug pipeline coming in the future.

stocks,Alibaba shares rise 3% in premarket after Chinese tech giant posts 58% jump in profit,"Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba on Friday beat profit expectations in its September quarter, citing an acceleration in growth in its cloud business unit.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

investing,Isn't rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers?,"I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals. 

So say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC. 

That strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet. 

So here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"".

That’s how I made my first investment in an individual stock, with regular small to medium purchases for several years. 

Although I started investing in other stocks that first one kept growing until it was out sizing my portfolio. Everything I was reading, and everyone I spoke with - to this day - warns against having an out sized investment in one individual company.

I was going through my allocations and loaded everything in Empower’s app and once again I saw an alert that I had a lot in one security and should diversify. I had a really emotional NO reaction to seeing that. If I compare the funds I reinvested when I sold off a bunch, the gains are nowhere comparable.

I’m reflecting on the GFC and I am wondering if money markets are really where I want to put some money.  Maybe I should consider long term treasury etf.  This would be money set aside specifically to buy stocks at discount in a market crash.  If there was a deflationary crash, long term bond prices should increase as people flock to safety.   I’m just not sure money markets are as safe as treasury etf.  What are your thoughts?",0.225,0.06985294117647058
investing,Tax-efficient options for short term savings,"Hi there,
I want to set park ~200k in something very low risk for a down-payment within next year. Thing is, I have a very high marginal tax rate (37%) and live in MA (5% state income tax).

In doing a little research on vanguard, I found a couple interesting options:
-  VMSXX (municipal MM fund) tax free federal, but subject to state tax I assume
- VMATX (MA tax-exempt fund) tax free, but looks like a lot higher risk than the MM fund. Not sure if it’s too much risk or not..

investing,DCA Into multiple instruments,"Hey there,

I'm trying to learn the ropes on investing, and am working on my strategy. My plan is to put ~75% into an index (probably S&P 500) and leave the remaining 25% for more volatile, riskier trades. I'm young and all of the (limited) money I'll be investing is strictly left-over, so I'm very comfortable with any losses.

My first question is, does this sound like a sensible split?

And secondly, I plan to invest my left-over money monthly. I believe this is called dollar cost averaging, or at least will be an adaptation of it. So how do I decide how to split it across my instruments, considering that the initial 75/25 split won't remain constant once I make gains or losses. And, for my more volatile stocks, is it worth holding off and putting money in at times when they're lower?

I hope you'll forgive me if any of these questions seem silly.

investing,My mom (69) is asking me if she should invest in the stock market ,"My mom doesn’t make much money. She’s had enough where she can retire in a few years, but money will be tight. She recently started asking me about investing in the stock market because she’s hearing it’s going up. I told her that in my opinion at her age, if you invest in the stock market, you have to be prepared to lose it. Because even though the market will usually go back up, it might not come up  by the time that she needs it.

investing,Understanding the Lifecycle of Mining Stocks,"I have recently had some pretty good luck with AI stocks picks, and I'd like to continue to expose myself to the trend of robotics and AI/Renewable energy by investing in some companies that harvest the raw materials used in the manufacture of those goods.  I have some questions about mining companies that I haven't been able to find any decent answers to online though, and I was hoping you all would have some resources to point me towards or best practices. 

1. I'm currently invested in $TMQ.  It's performing very well right now, though I have no idea why.  I am chalking it up to sentiment, U.S. located mine, and restricted copper supply.  $TMQ is an exploration company though.  Eventually, that company will need to actually mine the minerals, and my understanding is that the mining is done through a separate, new company.  Is there a standard practice to this?  Will there be a spin off, or will $TMQ create a wholly owned subsidiary and I will continue to hold just the one stock?  I assume this is an ""it depends"" situation, but is there a general case?  

  
2. Mining companies are unique in that even the best run mines have a shelf life (the amount of metals available in the land holdings).  How do mining companies dispense value to share holders over the life of the mine?  Are they generally high dividend stocks or is the impetus on me to sell at some magical valuation moment.  I doubt that the value of the stock is ownership in the underlying commodity, I just don't understand how the shareholder captures value, and what the timing of that capture is.

investing,Novice Investor who needs to pick some investment options for my mom.  ,"Good day!  

I honestly know little about investing, but realizing I really need to learn for myself and family.  

Currently I am looking to re-invest some money for my mom.  An annuity of hers recently matured and she was recommended by her advisor to put it back into another annuity to avoid taxes/fees for now.  From what I understand, you can do a 1035 into a new annuity and all the money gets transferred, no taxes or fees get subtracted.  

Is this a good idea or should she be looking at something other than another annuity (even if she has to pay taxes to get the money out)? She made a decent return on this last one and doesn't need immediate access to this money (about $300k) - she is really just looking for a place to put it so it grows and doesn't just sit there.  

Her house is paid for and she has few monthly expenses and checking/savings accounts that should have more than enough to support her.

I am not hearing a lot of positives on VAs so was just wondering good alternatives for someone with money already in a matured VA and is just looking for a conservative way to grow that money for a few years.

investing,SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Depart Agency on January 20,"Washington D.C., Nov. 21, 2024 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.

“The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” said Chair Gensler. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.

“I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I’ve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Lizárraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.”

**Treasury Markets**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.

**Equity Markets**

Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers’ execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.

**Resiliency**

The Commission adopted amendments during Chair Gensler’s tenure regarding Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The amended rules require that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission. The SEC further amended Form PF jointly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to improve the quality of the information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers, and those changes will be implemented next year. Finally, the Commission adopted reforms to money market funds to make them more resilient, liquid, and transparent, including in times of stress.

**Corporate Governance**

To better promote trust in the capital markets, the SEC under Chair Gensler adopted a number of changes regarding corporate governance, including updating the rules for when corporate insiders can sell their shares, for when executives have to give back compensation based on erroneously reported financials, and for disclosure of executive pay versus performance. The agency also adopted new rules to allow shareholders to vote their preferred mix of board candidates on universal proxy cards in contested director elections. Additionally, the Commission adopted rules requiring more timely disclosure by those who are seeking control and buy more than a 5 percent stake in a company.

**Disclosure**

Since April 2021, the Commission has adopted several rules to ensure that investors get the disclosure they need from public companies and companies seeking to go public, broker-dealers, and investment advisors.

First, the Commission adopted rules to enhance disclosure around public company issuers’ cyber and climate risks, as well as for those companies seeking to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. The rules are grounded in materiality, as investors need this information to make buying, selling, holding, and voting decisions.

Second, the Commission adopted rules requiring certain broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.

Finally, the Commission enhanced transparency to the markets by regularly publishing aggregate, anonymized data regarding registered investment funds, private funds, and investment advisers.

**Accounting and Auditing**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), overseen by the SEC, successfully negotiated a Statement of Protocol with Chinese market authorities to allow the PCAOB to fully inspect and investigate, for the first time, the auditors of China-related companies listed in the United States. For the last two years, the PCAOB has been able to fulfill its inspection and enforcement-related responsibilities as it relates to audit firms in China and Hong Kong.

Further, in April 2021, the PCAOB had only updated five of the standards it adopted on an interim basis when it was created 20 years ago. The interim standards had been carried over from existing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act envisioned that the PCAOB would update them soon after its creation. Since Chair Gensler was sworn in, the PCAOB has updated 18 interim standards and two other standards to reflect the current oversight needs in accounting and auditing.

**Examinations and Enforcement**

The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, which make up about half of the agency, have been steadfast cops on the beat during Chair Gensler’s tenure. The agency received more than 145,000 tips, complaints, and referrals and awarded approximately $1.5 billion to whistleblowers. The Commission filed more than 2,700 enforcement actions and obtained approximately $21 billion in penalties and disgorgement orders. Between fiscal years 2021 and 2024, the agency returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors as a result of enforcement actions.

Further, the SEC recovered more than $250 million for harmed investors through examination of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker dealers, among others. The Division of Examinations also enhanced communication with registrants by sharing more timely information about its annual priorities and observations and proactively engaging with industry and other regulators.

Under Chair Gensler, the Commission continued the work Chair Jay Clayton began to protect investors in the crypto markets. During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the agency brought actions against crypto intermediaries for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct.

In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC’s tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets. Court after court [agreed](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424#_ftn37) with the Commission’s actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered—whatever their form.

**About Chair Gensler**

He also was senior advisor to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and was undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance and assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997-2001.

From 2017-2019, he served as chair of the Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission.

Earlier in his career, Chair Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner in the Mergers & Acquisition department, headed the firm’s Media Group, led fixed income & currency trading in Asia, and was co-head of Finance, responsible for the firm's worldwide Controllers and Treasury efforts.

A native of Baltimore, Md., Chair Gensler earned his undergraduate degree in economics in 1978 and his MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, in 1979. He has three daughters.

investing,Advice on what to do with insurance policy funds,"My father recently transferred ownership of a life insurance policy to me that he started when I was just a year old. To my understanding, it’s a variable permanent life insurance policy, and I now have full control of it. The current beneficiaries are my father and my sister.

I’ve been seeking advice on what to do with this policy. One suggestion I received was to transfer it via a 1035 exchange into a variable annuity. However, I’m hesitant about this option because I dislike the idea of having limited access to my funds until retirement and having them managed by an external company.

At this stage in my life, my investments are structured primarily for growth. I’m 23, with no dependents or immediate plans for large purchases in the next few years. That said, I’d like to position myself to use some of my portfolio’s gains toward a down payment on a home in the future.

Currently, I’m considering cashing out the policy, paying the associated capital gains tax, and reallocating the funds into a taxable brokerage account, where I can invest in a mix of ETFs or index funds to maintain flexibility and control.

Here’s a summary of how I’ve structured my investments:
• Roth IRA (maxed yearly, with VOO and QQQ holdings)
• VTSAX 
• 401(k)
• High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)
• Some cryptocurrency
• Individual blue-chip stocks


Given that I already actively manage my investments and have a clear plan, I’m leaning toward cashing out rather than transferring to a variable annuity. However, I’d appreciate any insights or alternative perspectives you might have. It’s possible there are aspects of this decision that I haven’t fully considered since I am still learning as I grow.

investing,My philosophy on investing in real estate vs stocks...would like to hear opinions,"TL,DR: If forecasted first-year cash flow on a property exceeds that of the stock market (\~6% COC return, inflation-adjusted), I think that's a green flag to buy a property...because cash flow should get better each year with mortgage paydown.

Full details...

26 year old guy, single, no kids, renter, no debt, good net worth/financial cushion. Current asset allocation is \~70/30 stocks/bonds.

So...I'm planning to begin replacing bonds, then eventually stocks, with real estate. Obviously...the math has the math out for it to be worth it, because of the low liquidity of real estate. The hard metric that I use to make decisions is inflation-adjusted cash-on-cash return (appreciation is a nice bonus of real estate). 

Adjusted for inflation, I think \~6% is a reasonable annual ROI to expect from the stock market...so my philosophy is that my first year COC return should be \~6%+ (since real estate appreciation should ""offset"" inflation"") for it to be worth replacing stocks with real estate (or possibly a bit higher, due to capital gains taxes from selling index funds). With mortgage paydown, the ""6%"" should go up each year, but the low liquidity of real estate scares me a bit...and who knows if we're near a housing bubble.

I hope this is the right sub for this...

I (31 year old, male) am looking to set myself up for success and retirement, and have been reading lots of blogs and books about future planning.

But, I am not sure what that means...

Does that mean the first $100k in your retirement savings aka 401k/ 403b? Does that mean first $100k in stocks outside of a 401k/ 403b? Or does that mean a $100k value in some other manner like stock holdings outside of non tax advantaged vehicles?

I have worked both in the for profit and non profit industries so have both a 401k AND a 403b that combine to a value of $103,000. Just over $100k. Yay! Does that mean I have hit the elusive first benchmark of $100k? 

Moving forward, I will continue to push as much of my income as possible into my retirement but I am curious if there is something else I should be thinking about. Any clarity or insights is appreciated.

investing,Investing in What You Know: Modern Tools for Finding Hidden Gems,"In 'One Up On Wall Street' (great book, highly recommend) Peter Lynch emphasizes the idea of ""investing in what you know"". Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn’t his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin’ Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She’s the one who discovered L’eggs.”*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don’t live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street’s radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa—surely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I’m curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven’t gone mainstream yet. I’ve thought about using tools like Amazon's “top rated” section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in.

investing,Investing into a small business (restaurant) ,"TLDR: A family friend is asking me to be an investor for her new restaurant.

She used to owe a restaurant in NYC and made it to local television news and Asian news paper. She showed me her revenue and one year the restaurant made $1.1M.

She had to close the restaurant because her business partners weren’t paying the bills.

So now she’s trying to open a restaurant, in the same neighborhood her old one is and under a completely different DBA. She didn’t ask me to be her business partner and I don’t want to either. She instead asked me to be an investor. I would have 10% stake in the company in exchange for $20k.

I have the funds for it.

Any advice or stories you can share is greatly appreciated. TIA!

UPDATED: 
I asked for the tax forms from 2020 - 2021 (closed 2021) 

Both years were at a loss. 
$165k and $145k respectively. 

Gross 
$357k (2020)
$763k (2021)

I didn’t see the $1.1M number. 

Definitely not gonna invest.

philip morris PE 9, yeild 7.  

AT and T.  PE 18 yeild 5, 

Gold miners GDX PE 31, 

consumer staples XLP PE 31, yeild 2.6

BRK which has a PE of 9.6 (but what does that really mean with BRK anyway)

money market which is getting about 4.5% right now with fidelity.  

  
I was thinking 50% in brk, then 25% money markets, then split the rest 

  
i worried about the consumer staples and gold miners funds though, because if i believe the PEs will fall, these fund is aready around 30, so may not be great.  

please give me your ideas where to invest if we do have recession/inflation due to these factors

investing,Considering building a new 10Y high risk portfolio. Any thoughts? ,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors?

investing,Does Jim Cramer Really Tell Viewers Not To Own More Than 10 Stocks???,"My dad is a retiree that fancies himself a sophisticated investor because he watches CNBC.

“Cramer, a real smart man that knows a thing or two, say you should never own more than 10 stocks”

I explained that horrible advice and that he must be misunderstanding. He of course defiantly responded about a “difference of opinion” but when I went to look it up to debunk it, I found some quotes that make it sound like Cramer might ACTUALLY be saying this to his retail viewers!?

investing,Need some advice on where to invest $3 million,"
Recently my uncle passed away very unexpectedly. He left behind 3 million I believe in his portfolio. My aunt doesn’t know what to do with this money. I have been learning about stocks for a little over a month now, just reading some books and trading myself. I have made $500 when Trump got elected and because of this I guess my family thinks i’m the most qualified to give advice on what to do. I’m only 20 with 10k to my name and now it sounds like they are ready to make big financial decisions based off of what I say. I really need advice on what to do here cause I honestly have no idea. It seems he is already getting $48,000 a year off dividends. I just got off the phone with my Mom and my aunt seems most concerned with securing a method of getting passive income, so I suggested investing into dividend focused index funds. I also told them they could put the money into something like VOO if they want growth. I don’t know if this is even good advice for $3 million, to me thats more money than I can even comprehend. My mom said shes gonna send me the company’s he was invested into to make sure they are good companies, and I have no idea how to do that but I just said I’ll look cause they seem to be understandably upset and I didn’t want to just say no. I’m in way over my head on this so any advice will be greatly appreciated. My mom said she is literally going to write down what I say.

I have almost zero knowledge about stocks, investments, etc. 5 years ago I moved to France from the US, and it is safe to say that I will not be moving back to the US. I'm working, married with a French woman, have a daughter. I have moved my entire life over here.

We are looking to buy a house here, and I am thinking that now is a good time to move my investments and USD to EUR. I was hoping for some advice. Also, general advice, as I see the USD is strong at the moment, buying 0.95€.

I have the following accounts:

* liquid/checking/savings: $1k, I've already been using this
* Invesco: $33k
* HSA: $7k
* 401k: $19k
* IRA: $3k

Moving Invesco incurs no fees, so that is a simpler question of just ""will it grow even more in the next few months?"". I'm leaning towards no, and to just go ahead and transfer that over, as an investment in a larger down payment for a house seems like a wiser choice.

The other accounts are all small retirement accounts. I know I would be hit with fees for withdrawing from them, but part of me wants to just go ahead and pull the money out and rip the bandaid off. what is more valuable, that $7k right now toward a house, or that money as and HSA in 32 years?

Or is that being too short-sighted? And it would actually be best to keep an investment vehicle in USD? Or save those retirement accounts for another 32 years (I'm currently 33)?

Any advice would be extremely appreciated.

investing,Conservative strategy assuming volatile markets and chaotic policies and regulating? ,"TL;DR: Given the current volatility and uncertainty explained in more detail below, and my conservative risk profile, I am looking at (1) 1-3 year bond laddering probably through ~~defined term~~ target maturity bond ETF's, (2) defined outcome equity ETF's, and (3) some conservative equity ETF's. What are your thoughts on this strategy given the risk profile, and AIO or overthinking it?  
(regarding my thoughts on volatility and uncertainty - let's assume what I say below. I think discussion of this aspect should be in a separate post/thread - it is really interesting and really complex, and probably controversial and emotional. )

I am a conservative investor looking for capital preservation, inflation protection, and some value investing for the longer term. I am retired. I am fortunate. I have done well through my 401K, some investing outside of that, and tactical money management (e.g. refinancing mortgages, leveraging equity, simple lifestyle).  
(although I've missed some opportunities like Roth IRAs, I have benefited from my benign neglect investing strategy all those working years - index investing weighted towards equities, value investing, invest and forget - don't look at it more than once a month.

Assume for this question the markets will be volatile  
\- They might go up initially early in 2025 (both stocks and bonds) because of continuation of current economic activity and policies (lower inflation, stable employment, Fed rate small cuts, stable GDP increases, rising profits, Trump bump).  
\- But will go down (both stocks and bonds) because of chaos in government and changes in guiding principles and policies, rising inflation because of tariffs and bad policies and chaos, and eventually a downturn or worse.  
\- However, maybe the Street and bond vigilantes will force some better policies and more stability.

As a conservative investor in retirement, I am thinking of some combination of the following strategy (while not getting totally out of the market index ETFs):

1. Bond laddering (likely with ~~defined term~~ target maturity ETF's, high quality or even just treasuries) for 1, 2, and 3 year terms. This gives me some stability in yield if rates go down (e.g. 3 year terms), and some yield increase opportunities if interest rates go up (e.g. 1 year terms, or at the end of the 3 year terms). This likely keeps me above the inflation rate overall, and capital preservation with high quality, and income, no matter what the markets do. (I indicate ETF's because then I don't have to manage it and I have lots of options for terms, but with treasuries I might do that with actual bonds because they are relatively low effort to roll over, maybe even automatically?)
2. Stock buffer ETF's (defined outcome ETF's). This gives me equity upside although capped, and downside protection at least for the most likely downside (although I've even heard unlimited downside protection is out there too; haven't investigated yet). This provides capital preservation and rising market opportunities, no matter what the markets are doing. edit: I forgot a key aspect. These are typically term bounded to one or two years, and reset at the end of the term with new conditions. 
3. Conservative stock ETF's - utilities, dividends (quality), consumer staples, and broad market indexes although at a lower allocation than 2. This enables larger market opportunities, and risks less on the downside near term. In my world, these will be the 'alternatives' in my portfolio",0,0.5,7,1732225354.0,Conservative strategy assuming volatile markets and chaotic policies and regulating? ,"TL;DR: Given the current volatility and uncertainty explained in more detail below, and my conservative risk profile, I am looking at (1) 1-3 year bond laddering probably through ~~defined term~~ target maturity bond ETF's, (2) defined outcome equity ETF's, and (3) some conservative equity ETF's.

I am based in Australia and used to work for a company that is from the UK.

They gave me stock options as part of the package and I am looking at selling them to pay for specialist healthcare.

As I understand it I have to pay the 91.19 gbp per share to exercise it, then I can sell them for the current value of 3,347.41 gbp?

On reading in the past people seemed to recommend selling without exercising but its saying the nominal value is 0.01 gbp so I assume if I sell them without exercising I will get a whopping 0.06 gbp?

This is my first time dealing with options and I just want to get the most I can out of it, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

*An instinctive understanding of risk allows for this wild randomness in ways that a statistical measure such as volatility cannot. That is especially true for options traders, who, if asked for a contract insuring against too extreme a move, will simply name a price high enough to dissuade the buyer. Investors, in other words, do not think Mr Trump’s presidency will be predictable. They think its unpredictability is unpriceable.*

Im curious if anyone else is considering sitting the next year or so out. I feel that many of the policies proposed by the incoming administration will break the market.

investing,The Microstrategy dual flywheel,"I’ve been digging into what’s driving MicroStrategy’s price appreciation, and wanted to share my understanding. This isn’t investment advice or a recommendation in any direction and just descriptive. 

There are two components to this flywheel. The stock price premium and convertible bonds.


---

**Stock Price Premium**

MicroStrategy leverages its stock price premium (200%+ above its Bitcoin holdings) to grow its Bitcoin per share efficiently:

- 
   Example: Raising $1 billion at a 216% premium results in just $316 million in dilution but adds $1 billion in Bitcoin. Each raise increases Bitcoin per share, further fueling the premium in a self-reinforcing cycle.

- 
   The strategy combines:
   1. Bitcoin price appreciation - assumed 25% annually.  
   2. Bitcoin Yield - efficiently raising capital at a premium, targeting 8% annual growth.  
   3. Leverage - low-interest debt adds further returns.  

-   This could potentially grow $15 billion into $87 billion over five years, but it hinges on sustaining the premium—if it collapses, the strategy breaks.

- 
   Owning 252,000 BTC (more than all public companies combined) positions MicroStrategy as a unique bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin, with future potential in lending or derivatives.

---

**Convertible Bonds**

MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds attract investors by combining bond safety with Bitcoin upside:

- Investors lend money via bonds (e.g., 0.75% interest) with the option to convert to $MSTR shares. This gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth without directly holding it.

- Investor Benefits:  
   - Downside Protection: Fixed interest payments and principal repayment safeguard against Bitcoin volatility.  
   - Upside Potential: If $MSTR stock rises with Bitcoin, bondholders can convert and profit.  
   - Premium Boost: Since $MSTR trades at a premium, conversion offers amplified returns compared to Bitcoin alone.

-  
   An investor buying $1,000 in bonds earns annual interest but can convert to shares if Bitcoin rallies, gaining equity upside with limited risk.
